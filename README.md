# ChallengeWK4
Bootcamp challenge for week 4

In this Challenge, we were tasked to modify the javascript to create a random password generator. The password should give the user various prompts to customize their random password, utilizing uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters.  Upon selecting the various characters, the user is given a password with the lenght of their choosing. 

This challenge was incredibly helpful in gaining a better understanding of functions and how they reference eachother.
